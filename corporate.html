        <h2>SHOWS FOR BUSINESS</h2>
            <p>
                If you’re seeking entertainment for your conference, meeting or celebration, Improv at The Comedy Palace can customize an improv show specifically for your needs.

                You’ll get hilarious improvised, and/or improvised within an outline, and/or written sketches, tailored specifically for your organization, including songs & audience participation, all with costumed impersonations of specific people in your company.

                You can also choose a show with specific people in your group being interviewed by the cast and/or telling works stories, or use your organization’s and/or area of specialty’s newsletters, memos, articles, etc., which would inspire our improvised scenes. 

                Our team has two graduates of the famous Chicago’s The Second City Sketch Writing Program, three graduates of The Second City’s Improv Conservatory, which uses improv to produce sketches, as well as a graduate of L.A.’s The Groundlings, which also specializes in creating sketches. We’ll customize a show, big or small, for anything related to your company/area of specialty.  Our team consists of San Diego’s finest improvisers, and we guarantee we’ll create an experience which your team will remember fondly for years to come!

                We’re also a perfect fit for a very special holiday party or event entertainment option!
            </p>
        <h2>WORKSHOPS FOR BUSINESS</h2>
            <p>
                If you’re looking for an entertaining, unintimidating, highly participatory, uniquely educational, and most importantly, FUN team building idea, Improv at The Comedy Palace is for you. 

                Attentive listening, empathy, trust, and practicing and observing nonverbal language and tone, are skills that add tremendous benefit to organizations, and are the core skills used in improv. 

                Using the magic improv formula of, “Yes, and!”, your team will be amazed at how the positive power of improv can teach them to:

                Have their coworkers’ backs by putting team needs over ego 

                Know their coworkers in a new light (this is always fun!)

                Say yes to the moment, and say yes to each other

                Think quickly by disregarding their critical mind

                Produce positive, uninhibited idea generation

                Practice more effective presentation skills

                Have FUN while doing it all!

                The same principles we teach in our Improv at The Comedy Palace improv classes are reviewed in our corporate workshops. Specifically, overcoming the “5 Obstacles to a Direct Experience” presented by the godmother of modern improvisation, Viola Spolin:

                The Approval/Disapproval Syndrome - Getting over trying to please others

                Self-Pity - Conquer self defeat

                Success/Failure - Transcend opposites of negative and positive

                Attitudes - Drop appearances and learn to deal with the problem

                Fear - Defeat fear through a direct experience

                We realize and respect that some participants are more shy than others, and we promise a safe and comfortable experience for all.

        <h2>PRICES/LOCATION</h2>
