                    "Paul Cross was a top performer at iO for years and a very funny man at that. But more importantly, he was dedicated to the work. Now he is spreading the word of iO with his San Diego improv classes, and I trust him to teach it well. You can too." — Charna Halpern - Mother of modern improvisation, Owner of iO Chicago, Author of "Truth in Comedy" & "Art By Committee: A Guide to Advanced Improvisation"

                    "I can’t wait to see what happens with Improv at The Comedy Palace, because Paul is the real deal! I had the pleasure of playing with him on my favorite team at iO Chicago — Fox Force Five. Paul is intelligent, hilarious, and a team player. When you play with him you always know he has an eye on the piece as a whole and that he supports you and has your back." — Robyn Lynne Norris - Taught at The Second City Hollywood and Westside Comedy Theater, Creator of the Off-Broadway show #DateMe: An OkCupid Experiment, which she starred in during its Los Angeles (as Undateable) and Chicago runs.

                    "The cost of attendance is merely an afterthought. I challenge you to find an improv class with less than 10 attendees for a cheaper price than this! Paul is knowledgeable, a great teacher, friendly, but not afraid to call you out with constructive criticism. I have really enjoyed this class, it’s been a great opportunity for me to get out of my comfort zone and practice something that I have always wanted to be good at. Not only are the classes tons of fun, but you get a chance to meet some really fun people that are also attending the class! Paul is passionate about improv, and inspiring that passion in his students. It is clear that Paul only wants to watch us all grow and hone our improv skills." — Ron Rast

                    "Because of the honest feedback and expertise, I feel like my abilities and confidence in improv have developed immensely. Before these classes, I was unsure of myself and just plain scared of failure, so my mind and mouth were overworking. I learned to say, “Forget my fear, and mess stuff up!” I learned to shut up, listen, and ‘put a period on it’ in order to let the scene develop organically vs. forcing my idea. I learned to really feel and react through the lens of my character, and that simply responding to the last thing said can get me out of my head and back to listening to my partner. Most importantly, I was instilled with a fiery passion and love of improv that was not there before during my other San Diego improv classes." — Eddie Ruiz

                    "Paul has a deep relation to the art and philosophy of improv, yet he is an unassuming teacher, sort of an ordinary guy. He was gentle with the beginners, but firm enough to make clear what we were all trying to achieve with the exercises. It reminded me of my first improv class, when I rediscovered the joy of playing “make believe.” That’s what got me hooked in the first place - a bunch of strangers feeling comfortable enough to enjoy being really weird around each other, with not a speck of judgement in the room. I had that same feeling in Paul’s class." — Andy Robinson

                    "If you want to be more confident, quicker on your feet and FUNNIER in real life, take this class! Despite everyone starting at different places, Paul did a great job of bringing us together as a team. He didn’t give generic instruction, but rather watched super carefully and gave me critique that would help me out where I’m at. Paul’s a professional who’s passionate about the craft and it’s been a fun, yet challenging time learning with him. There’s no substitute for someone who actually knows what he’s talking about, and that guy is Paul!" — Rob Rast

                    "This class has helped me with my screenwriting far more than I ever expected it to. If you write, especially if you write pieces meant to be performed, I can’t recommend this enough. There is an ocean of difference between creating a scene purely in your head and creating a scene while speaking the dialogue and moving your body. You are not imagining a scene any more. You are creating a lived moment. It’s a lived moment that you get real time, visceral feedback on. Not the usual feedback that is other writers telling you how to write better. These are immediate, emotional responses. You come away knowing what actually worked and what didn’t. It will completely change the way you write for the better, I promise you." — Gwen Loubser
