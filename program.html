                Mick Napier’s book, “Improvise: Scene from the Inside Out”, is highly recommended for our students, and will help tremendously through their journey of our classes. Mick’s improv philosophy matches very well with Improv at The Comedy Palace’s improv philosophy, and makes us truly unique in San Diego improv classes.

        <h2>EACH LEVEL HAS 7 CLASSES</h2>
        <div class="levels">
            <div class="single-level">
                <h3>Level 1</h3>
                <span class="sub-heading">ATTENTION/AWARENESS - “A” of our improv abc’s</span>
                <p>The most basic, yet most important thing to do in improv is to pay attention, to be aware of everything that is going on with yourself, your partner and the scene.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make strong declarative statements to start a scene, then keep the “Deal” of the 1st 3 lines of the scene</li>
                    <li>Recognize your Character’s physical/vocal/emotional “quirkphrases”</li>
                    <li>Begin using the filter of your Characters</li>
                    <li>Less is more - Put a period on it</li>
                    <li>Use silence, utilize other tools (besides words) during silence</li>
                    <li>Give yourself something. Say something. Do something. Justify it later.</li>
                    <li>Recognize the “first unusual thing”, instead of inventing</li>
                    <li>Concepts of push/pull/hold</li>
                    <li>Follow the fear, follow the failure</li>
                    <li>Objects and Environment to add to Characters and Scenes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="single-level">
                <h3>Level 2</h3>
                <span class="sub-heading">BUILD/HEIGHTEN - “B” of our improv abc’s</span>
                <p>Take what you have paid attention to, and build/heighten it by giving yourself the gifts of specifics, a strong point of view, creating the game of the scene and beginning to raise the stakes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep/maintain the promise you made at the top of the scene with the 1st 3 lines of the scene</li>
                    <li>Thinking/Reacting like your Characters, begin investigating the psychology of your Characters</li>
                    <li>Recognize and play with status - Lose confidently</li>
                    <li>React with emotion - Show, don’t tell - Utilize Physicality/Clowning Principles</li>
                    <li>Character development - Heighten aspects of yourself for Characters</li>
                    <li>Learn how to break “improv rules” - Agreement is always implied - Learn how to say, “No” </li>
                    <li>Maintain your Character’s Point of View with specifics</li>
                    <li>2 person scene work </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="single-level">
                <h3>Level 3</h3>
                <span class="sub-heading">COMMIT - “c” of our improv abc’s</span>
                <p>In order for your scene (and show) to work, you must commit to your character’s “Deal”, commit to the promise you made at the top of the scene with the 1st 3 lines of the scene, and commit to the “Deal” of the scene. Committing can seem difficult, but it actually makes your playing more easeful, joyful, rewarding and funny.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Raise the stakes even higher of what you’ve established and built/heightened</li>
                    <li>Even further investigation of the psychology of your Characters</li>
                    <li>Embrace the awkwardness of not knowing exactly what is happening or what will happen</li>
                    <li>Reinforce commitment to your Character with Historical/Metaphorical/Philosophical specificity</li>
                    <li>Commit to the filter of your Character’s relation to the environment and other characters </li>
                    <li>3 person scene work </li>
