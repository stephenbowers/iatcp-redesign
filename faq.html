                <p class="answer">
                    No.  But we’re pretty sure if you continue in the classes, you’ll really want to! You can be included in our weekly Thursday online show as a student, starting late Level 1 or sometime in Level 2.

                    Plenty of free lot parking directly surrounding the theater, conveniently located right off the 163. This simple luxury separates us from all other San Diego improv classes and shows.

                <p class="answer">
                    Yes. Everyone is nervous on their first day of improv class. But that changes quickly. We are all in this together, that’s what improv is, supporting each other. We want you to succeed. When fear does show up, we follow the fear, and we make the fear funny. Improv always wins, fear doesn’t win in improv.

                </p>
                <p class="answer">
                    No. You don’t have to be funny, in fact, we discourage you from “trying to be funny.” Improv is about exploring the truths of life, and putting a spin on them. The funny will come from the truth. The funny comes from playing an interesting, true character, and characters are easier to do than you might think. Your life experience is more than enough for you to be an incredible improviser.

                    WHY SHOULD I CHOOSE IMPROV AT THE COMEDY PALACE FOR CLASSES?
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
                    We have a shorter program than other improv schools, with only 3 Levels. This is because we don’t waste time with warm ups, we don’t focus on teaching improv “forms”, and our teaching technique, our curriculum and our focus on individual feedback allows you to learn the art form quicker

                    Lots of scene work

                    No “pay to play” policy

                    Strong focus on Characters

                    Lots of stage time available

                    Class max of 8 to ensure individual attention

                    10% Discount if purchasing Levels 2 & 3 in a lump sum, after taking Level 1

                    No focus on warm ups or learning improv forms, rather, we focus on making you the best improviser you can be, with a strong focus on Characters
